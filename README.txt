== Welcome to Whistler! ==

This is an IRC bot written in node.js that makes crank calls using text-to-speech (TTS).

It employs cepstral & asterisk to get the job done on the back-end.

You should be able to strip out cepstral for another TTS engine, like festival without a lot of work.

== Requirements ==

Requires extra node modules:
- irc
- exec-sync

Requires internal (should come with your node) modules:
- fs

== Install ==

Firstly, you should be able to get the modules you need right in this cwd with npm, 

[user@host]$ npm install

It should read from the package.json included here.

Or install the packages manually. ("npm install module-name" for each required module)

== Basic Usage ==
